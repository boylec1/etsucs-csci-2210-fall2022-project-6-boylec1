Repository for Project 6


Added this here and made it Public, hope that means you can read it. If not, please let me know and I'll get it to you some other way.

Used the NuGet code from the Book for the AVL Tree implementation, header comments indicate that as the author.

Though I know you posted a way to properly split the file lines into Book information, I had already written mine at that point, and it worked. So instead of
copying over your MUCH nicer code, I just left mine. Hope that's not a problem. It's ugly, but it does the job.
